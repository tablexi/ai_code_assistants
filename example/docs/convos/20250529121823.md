# Goal Tracker Application Conversation Summary - May 29, 2025

## Project Summary
A cross-platform goal tracking application to help users monitor progress toward goals. The application will allow users to create goals with names, start dates, and frequency settings (daily, weekly, monthly), and mark them with different statuses (pending, active, completed, or abandoned). The solution will include both a web interface and iOS app with shared codebase.

## Technical Decisions
After exploring various technology options, we settled on:

### Frontend:
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo
  - Maximizes code sharing between web and iOS platforms
  - Provides native iOS experience while maintaining a single codebase

### Backend:
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
  - Enables future data processing capabilities
  - High-performance asynchronous API design
  - Selected over the initially recommended Node.js solution

### Database & Authentication:
- **Provider**: Supabase
  - PostgreSQL database with built-in authentication
  - Row-level security and real-time capabilities
  - Simplifies development compared to separate database/auth solutions

### Deployment:
- **Backend**: Fly.io (chosen over Heroku for better pricing and global distribution)
- **Frontend Web**: Vercel (excellent React integration)
- **iOS**: App Store via Expo build services

## Conversation Flow
1. Initial requirements gathering for a cross-platform goal tracking application
2. Exploration of technology options with initial recommendations for:
   - React Native + Expo (frontend)
   - Node.js + Express (backend)
   - MongoDB Atlas (database)
   - Heroku (backend deployment)
   - Vercel (web deployment)
3. Consideration of UK regulatory requirements (GDPR, Cookie Law)
4. Client preference for Python-based backend for future data processing needs
5. Refinement of architecture to accommodate Python backend (FastAPI)
6. Integration of Supabase for authentication and database
7. Documentation of final architecture decisions in `example/docs/decisions/initial_agreed_plan.md`

## Next Steps
The implementation plan will proceed in phases:
1. Setup core backend with FastAPI and Supabase
2. Build shared UI components with React Native and Expo
3. Complete web interface
4. Develop iOS app
5. Perform testing and deployment

This conversation demonstrates how AI code assistants can help explore technical options, document decisions, and create a structured plan before writing any code.
