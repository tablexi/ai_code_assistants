# Goal Tracker Application: Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step approach to implementing the Goal Tracker application, starting with the React Native frontend.

## React Native Frontend Setup

### 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Install Node.js (v18.x or later) and npm
- [ ] Install Expo CLI: `npm install -g expo-cli`
- [ ] Install Watchman for better performance (recommended for macOS): `brew install watchman`
- [ ] Set up Expo account (if not already created) for deployment

### 2. Project Initialization
- [ ] Create new Expo project: `expo init goal-tracker`
- [ ] Select template: "blank (TypeScript)"
- [ ] Set up project structure:
  ```
  goal-tracker/
  ├── assets/          # Images, fonts, etc.
  ├── components/      # Reusable UI components
  │   ├── common/      # Shared components
  │   ├── forms/       # Form components
  │   └── goals/       # Goal-related components
  ├── navigation/      # Navigation configuration
  ├── screens/         # Application screens
  ├── services/        # API services
  ├── store/           # State management
  ├── types/           # TypeScript type definitions
  └── utils/           # Utility functions
  ```
- [ ] Initialize Git repository

### 3. Dependencies Installation
- [ ] Install navigation libraries:
  ```
  npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack @react-navigation/bottom-tabs
  expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
  ```
- [ ] Install UI library (choose one):
  ```
  # Option 1: React Native Paper
  npm install react-native-paper react-native-vector-icons
  expo install react-native-safe-area-context

  # Option 2: Native Base
  npm install native-base
  expo install react-native-svg react-native-safe-area-context
  ```
- [ ] Install state management (choose one):
  ```
  # Option 1: Redux Toolkit
  npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

  # Option 2: Context API (built-in to React)
  ```
- [ ] Install form handling: `npm install react-hook-form`
- [ ] Install date handling: `npm install date-fns`
- [ ] Install API client: `npm install axios`

### 4. Configure Supabase Integration
- [ ] Create Supabase project
- [ ] Install Supabase client: `npm install @supabase/supabase-js`
- [ ] Set up environment variables for Supabase URLs and keys
- [ ] Create `supabase.ts` client configuration

### 5. Setup Basic Navigation
- [ ] Create navigation structure with stack and tab navigators
- [ ] Set up authentication flow (unauthenticated vs. authenticated routes)
- [ ] Create placeholder screens:
  - [ ] Login/Registration screens
  - [ ] Goals list screen
  - [ ] Goal detail screen
  - [ ] Create/Edit goal screen
  - [ ] Profile/Settings screen

### 6. Implement Authentication Screens
- [ ] Design and implement Login screen
- [ ] Design and implement Registration screen
- [ ] Create authentication service for Supabase integration
- [ ] Implement password reset functionality
- [ ] Set up protected routes

### 7. Implement Core Data Models
- [ ] Create TypeScript interfaces for data models:
  - User model
  - Goal model
  - Progress tracking model
- [ ] Set up API service functions for CRUD operations

### 8. Implement Goal Management Features
- [ ] Create goal list component with filtering options
- [ ] Implement goal creation form
- [ ] Build goal detail view with progress tracking
- [ ] Add goal editing functionality
- [ ] Implement goal status management (pending, active, completed, abandoned)

### 9. Build Shared Components
- [ ] Create custom button components
- [ ] Design form input components
- [ ] Build goal card component
- [ ] Implement progress indicators
- [ ] Create status badge component

### 10. Web-Specific Configurations
- [ ] Configure Expo for web
- [ ] Implement responsive design adaptations
- [ ] Test and optimize web interface

### 11. iOS-Specific Configurations
- [ ] Configure iOS-specific features
- [ ] Test on iOS simulator
- [ ] Optimize for iOS devices

### 12. Testing Setup
- [ ] Set up Jest for unit testing
- [ ] Configure React Testing Library for component tests
- [ ] Write basic tests for authentication flow
- [ ] Write tests for core components

### 13. CI/CD Setup
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions for CI
- [ ] Set up Expo EAS for build and deployment
- [ ] Configure Vercel for web deployment

## Backend Integration (Future Phase)
- [ ] Connect to FastAPI backend once it's implemented
- [ ] Integrate with Supabase real-time features
- [ ] Implement data synchronization for offline support

## Next Steps After Frontend Setup
Once the frontend foundation is established, we'll proceed with:
1. Setting up the FastAPI backend
2. Implementing the database schema in Supabase
3. Creating the API endpoints
4. Connecting frontend and backend components

This plan focuses on setting up the React Native with Expo frontend as requested. Each step builds upon the previous one to create a structured development approach.
