# Goal Tracker Application Setup - TODO List

## React Native with Expo Frontend Setup (Hello, World)

### 1. Initialize the Project
- [ ] Install Expo CLI globally: `npm install -g expo-cli`
- [ ] Create a new Expo project: `expo init goal-tracker-frontend`
  - Select the blank TypeScript template
- [ ] Navigate to the project directory: `cd goal-tracker-frontend`

### 2. Basic Project Structure
- [ ] Set up basic folder structure
  ```
  /src
    /components
    /screens
    /navigation
    /utils
    /hooks
    /types
  ```
- [ ] Create a basic App.tsx file that renders "Hello, World"

### 3. Install Essential Dependencies 
- [ ] Install Expo development dependencies: `expo install expo-status-bar expo-updates`
- [ ] Install navigation dependencies (for future screens): `npm install @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/stack`
- [ ] Install necessary packages for React Navigation: `expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context`
- [ ] Install Base UI library (React Native Paper): `npm install react-native-paper react-native-vector-icons`

### 4. Create Hello World Component 
- [ ] Create a simple HomeScreen component that displays "Hello, World"
- [ ] Implement basic styling for the HomeScreen

### 5. Configure App Entry Point
- [ ] Modify App.tsx to use the HomeScreen component
- [ ] Set up Paper provider for UI components
- [ ] Configure basic navigation shell (though we'll only have one screen for now)

### 6. Test the Application
- [ ] Run the app in development mode: `expo start`
- [ ] Test the web version: Press `w` in the Expo CLI
- [ ] Test on iOS simulator (if available): Press `i` in the Expo CLI
- [ ] Verify "Hello, World" appears on screen with proper styling

### 7. Prepare for Next Steps
- [ ] Create placeholder files for future components
- [ ] Document the initial setup process
- [ ] List the next features to implement after this initial setup

## Notes
- This setup focuses only on getting a minimal "Hello, World" application running
- Additional dependencies will be installed as needed for future features
- No backend integration is included in this initial setup
- The focus is on establishing the core project structure that will allow for easy expansion
