# Conversation Context: Goal Tracker Application Planning

## Current Project Status
We are planning a cross-platform goal tracking application with the following requirements:
- Allow users to create and track goals with names, start dates, and frequency settings
- Support different goal statuses (pending, active, completed, abandoned)
- Provide both web and iOS interfaces
- Share code between platforms to minimize maintenance

## Technical Decisions Made
We've established the following architecture:

1. **Frontend**: React Native with Expo
   - Selected for code sharing between web and iOS
   - Will use Vercel for web deployment
   - Will deploy iOS app through App Store via Expo services

2. **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
   - Selected over Node.js to support future data processing needs
   - Benefits from Python's data science ecosystem
   - Will be deployed on

3. **Database & Authentication**: Supabase
   - PostgreSQL database with built-in authentication
   - Provides row-level security and real-time capabilities
   - Simplifies development with integrated auth system

## Documentation Created
1. Architecture decision document saved to: `example/docs/decisions/initial_agreed_plan.md`
2. Conversation summary saved to: `docs/convos/20250529121823.md`

## Implementation Plan
We are planning to implement the application in phases:
1. Setup core backend with FastAPI and Supabase
2. Build shared UI components with React Native and Expo
3. Complete web interface
4. Develop iOS app
5. Test and deploy

## Next Steps
We are ready to begin working on initial implementation steps. The next logical actions would be:
1. Set up the project repository structure
2. Initialize the FastAPI backend
3. Configure Supabase for authentication and data storage
4. Begin implementing the core data models and API endpoints
5. Start building the React Native UI components

Please refer to these decisions as we move forward with implementation. When starting a new feature, review this context to maintain consistency with our architectural choices.
