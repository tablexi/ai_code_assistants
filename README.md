# AI Code Assistants

This repo was used during the AI Code Assistants workshop at the [Engineering Meetup on May 30th, 2025](TODO://link_to_recording). The purpose is to walk us through the use of Copilot in VS Code.

## FAQS

**Can I use Cursor/ Claude Code / another tool instead?**
Other coding assistants such as Cursor or Claude Code can be used in a similar way to Copilot, but there are some differences that you'd need to figure out for yourself as you followed along.

**I don't use VS Code or related IDE, can I use X instead?**
Theoretically, yes although, depending on what you're using instead, you might not have access to all of the features we'll be discussing. Feel free to follow along using your editor and code assistant of choice though.

**I don't have a Copilot license, how do I get one?**
Ask in the #eng-core channel in Slack if you need a license and don't have one yet.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview) (or other editor of choice set up and ready to go)
- [ ] [Copilot](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/setup) (or other code assistant of your choice set up and ready to go)
